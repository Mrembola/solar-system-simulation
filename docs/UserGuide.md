Solar System Simulation User Guide
Welcome to the Solar System Simulation! This interactive application allows you to explore a virtual model of our solar system. Navigate through space, adjust the speed of planetary rotations and orbits, and select specific planets to focus on. This guide will help you understand how to interact with the simulation and make the most out of your astronomical journey.

Navigating the Simulation
Rotate View: Click and drag your mouse across the screen to rotate the camera view around the solar system.
Zoom: Use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out, getting a closer look at planets or viewing the solar system from afar.
Pan: Hold down the right mouse button and drag to pan the camera view, allowing you to explore different parts of the solar system.
Using the Control Panel
The control panel is located at the top left corner of the simulation. It consists of sliders and a dropdown menu that allow you to control various aspects of the simulation.

Rotation Speed
Adjusting Rotation Speed: Use the "Rotation Speed" slider to speed up or slow down how quickly the planets rotate around their own axes. Moving the slider to the right increases the speed, while moving it to the left decreases it.
Orbit Speed
Adjusting Orbit Speed: The "Orbit Speed" slider controls the speed at which planets orbit around the Sun. Similar to the rotation speed, sliding to the right speeds up the orbital motion, and sliding to the left slows it down.
Focus on a Planet
Selecting a Planet: Use the "Focus on Planet" dropdown menu to select a specific planet. The camera view will automatically adjust to center on the selected planet, allowing for a detailed examination. The planets available in the dropdown menu include the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Tips for Enjoying the Simulation
Explore at Different Speeds: Experiment with different rotation and orbit speeds to see how they change your view of the solar system.
Take Your Time: There's a lot to see! Take your time exploring each planet and the unique features of their orbits and rotations.
Learn as You Go: Each planet in the simulation is modeled with care. Use this opportunity to learn more about the characteristics of each celestial body in our solar system.
Conclusion
Thank you for exploring the solar system with our simulation. Whether you're a seasoned astronomer or just beginning your journey into space, we hope this application provides you with a fun and educational experience. Enjoy your exploration!
