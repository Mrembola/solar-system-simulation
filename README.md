# Solar System Simulation

## Overview

The Solar System Simulation is an interactive web application designed to visualize the solar system in 3D. This project aims to provide an educational tool for users to learn about the planets and their motions, including rotation and orbit around the Sun. Built using Three.js, a WebGL library, this simulation offers a realistic and engaging experience for users of all ages interested in astronomy.

## Features

- **3D Exploration**: Navigate through a 3D representation of the solar system, viewing planets and their orbits.
- **Dynamic Controls**: Adjust the speed of planet rotations and orbits to see how these changes affect their motion.
- **Detailed Views**: Click on individual planets to zoom in and focus, providing detailed views and information.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to be responsive, the simulation works on various devices and screen sizes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser capable of running WebGL content (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- (Optional) Node.js and npm installed if you wish to run a local development server or work with a build system.

### Getting Started
